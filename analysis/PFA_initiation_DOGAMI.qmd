# Steep-slopes modeling for the Private Forest Accord

Landslides, debris flows, channels, fish.

Why a model?

Modeling strategies.

What the model must predict.

# Landslide initiation.

Shallow rapid landslides.

## Quantitative measures of susceptibility.

Landslide density; #/area.

Relation to rate, flux.

How to calculate? Census of landslide events within a delineated area.

Relate density to mappable attributes. Miller & Burnett 2007, frequency ratio: for some increment of predictor values, measure area, count landslides. Problems with frequency ratio - not obvious how to use it with more than one or two variables.

Other options. Classification models that provide probability: logistic regression, random forest, ....

These require sampling of nonlandslide points. Model output affected by sampling scheme.

## Predictors

Which attributes? Theory: balance of forces. infinite slope steady state, 3-D, time variable. Key factors: gradient, saturation depth, root reinforcement, soil and substrate geotechnical properties.

What is mappable?

-   Gradient.

-   Contributing area: for a storm of specified duration.

-   Soil depth - curvature + slope.

-   Stand age

-   Distance to road

-   Substrate - rock type.

# Data

## DOGAMI inventory. 

### Sources.

### Mapping protocol.

Serendipitous sample - not a census. Use local sampling strategy: [@zhu2017][@nowickijessee2018a]

Balanced or unbalanced sample.

Plots of landslide density and log(odds) versus predictors.
