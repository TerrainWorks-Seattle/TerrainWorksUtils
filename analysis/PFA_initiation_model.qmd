## Landslide Initiation susceptibility model for the Private Forest Accord

This document outlines the process for making the landslide initiation model for the Oregon Private Forest Accord project. We work with data generated from the PFA_Sampling_Multiple_DEMs document that is included in this package. This document outlines in more detail where the data for different predictors is sourced and the strategy for negative sampling.

The primary focus of this document is to outline the model-building process and decisions that resulted in the final model used in combination with the landslide runout model to generate riparian buffers for the Private Forest Accord. Broadly speaking, there were 3 major decisions made in this process:

1.  A method for feature selection.

2.  The type of model built.

3.  A spatio-temporal resampling strategy.

### About the data

```{r}
#| echo: false
source("../R/create_model_dataframe.R")
sample_pnts <- training_data[!(is.na(training_data$dist_to_road)), 2:length(training_data)]
sample_pnts$geo <- as.factor(sample_pnts$geo)

head(sample_pnts)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
points <- vect(cbind(sample_pnts[, "x"], y = sample_pnts[, "y"]))
points$yr <- sample_pnts$year
points$class <- sample_pnts$class
crs(points) <- "epsg:26910"
points <- project(points, "epsg:4326")

load("/Users/julialober/Documents/terrainworks/code/sandbox/data/oregon_map.Rdata")

ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = oregon, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat),
               color = "white", fill = "white") +
  # geom_spatvector(data = points[points$class == "neg", ],
  #                 mapping = aes(shape = as.factor(points[points$class == "neg", ]$yr)),
  #                 show.legend = TRUE, size = 1 , color = "black", alpha = 1) +
  geom_spatvector(data = points[points$class == "pos", ],
                  mapping = aes(shape = as.factor(points[points$class == "pos", ]$yr)),
                  show.legend = TRUE, size = 1, color = "red", alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(3, 1, 17), labels = c("1996 (213)", "2007 (137)", "2011 (47)")) + 
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", shape = "Study points (count)")
```

The data includes 767 landslide initiation points, with equal proportions of landslide points and non-landslide points. The data has obvious spatial distributions and is divided into 3 approximate year groups. Exact dates for the landslide record were not always available, so these should be viewed as groupings rather than divisions.

### Feature Selection

Choosing good features is an essential part of the machine learning process. A good model should use features that are correlated to the output class and independent from each other. The other main goal of feature selection is to choose the smallest possible set of features that produces a good model, which both reduces the runtime of training models and the risk of over-fitting. The definition of a "good model" can be difficult to define, but for our purposes, we use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a measure of model performance. A higher AUC indicates a better model, so the feature selection processes will try to maximize this value.

```{r}
#| echo: false
load("/Users/julialober/Documents/terrainworks/code/sandbox/filter_results.Rdata")

ggplot(results, aes(x = feature, y = c(rank.auc, rank.anova, rank, rank.cmim, rank.mim))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

### Logistic Regression model

A logistic regression model was chosen for two primary purposes: because it is simple to code into FORTRAN and because it performed just as well as the Random Forest model when exploring some different types of models.

The first reason is particularly important, as this is how the model will be implemented for predicting. The data sets for predicting encompass all of Oregon and would take a very long time to put through the model in a high-level language like R.

The figure below shows the measured performance across a couple of different types of model. Our performance measure for this comparison (and for feature selection) is the area under the ROC curve (or AUC). For a more detail on the comparisons that were performed between the Random Forest model and linear regression model, refer to the analysis/comparing_landslide_models document.

```{r}
#| echo: false
load("/Users/julialober/Documents/terrainworks/code/sandbox/data/3.14.pipelinetuneresult.Rdata")

to_plot <- cbind(as.data.frame(target_archive$classif.auc), (as.data.frame(target_archive$branch.selection)))
names(to_plot) <- c("auc", "model_type")
to_plot$model_type <- as.factor(to_plot$model_type)

ggplot(to_plot, aes(x = model_type, y = auc)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(col = model_type)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(col = model_type), position = position_jitter(0.2)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c("lr", "lr_fs", "rf", "rf_fs"), labels = c("LR", "LR with feature selection", "RF", "RF with feature selection")) + 
  xlab("Type of model") +
  ylab("Performance (AUC)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
